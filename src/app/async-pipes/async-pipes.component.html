<h1>AsyncPipe</h1>
<div class="info">
    <p>AsyncPipe can receive a Promise or Observable as input and subscribe to the input
    automatically, eventually returning the emitted value(s). </p><p>It is stateful because the pipe
    maintains a subscription to the input and its returned values depend on that subscription.
