<h1>Stateful Pipes</h1>
<div class="info">
    <p>Pipes are stateless by default. We must declare a pipe to be stateful by setting the <font color='red'> pure</font> property of the @Pipe decorator to false. </p>
    <p>This setting tells Angularâ€™s change detection system to check the output of this pipe each cycle, whether its input has changed or not.</p>
